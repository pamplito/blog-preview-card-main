## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Reset from Josh W Comeau
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

As I'm a beginner, I've learned a lot of little things thanks to this project. A lot of small things about the Grid, Custom Properties, the Mobile First process, etc., which means I've learned a lot.
There's still a lot of room for improvement, so I'd be very happy to have your advice and feedback about my challenge.

### Continued development

I'm going to continue training my CSS with challenges to progress and at the same time I'm starting with Javascript.
